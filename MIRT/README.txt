This package provides Matlab code with examples for 
the non-rigid 2D and 3D image registration.

1) INSTALLATION

Unpack the MIRT distribution archive.
Add 'MIRT' directory with all subdirectories to the Matlab path.


2) EXAMPLES

Please see many examples in the 'examples' directory for the details.
