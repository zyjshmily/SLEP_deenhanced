# SLEP_deenhanced


This is the registration code for "Correlation-weighted sparse representation for liver DCE-MRI decomposition registration". 

SLEP_deenhanced.m is the main file. 

SLEP_package_4.1 is the toolbox for de-enhancing DCE-MRI and MIRT is the registration toolbox. 


Also we added the correlation-weighted constraint into the SLEP toolbox named "sgLeastR_yj.m" and the related C++ code "altra_yj.h" and "altra_yj.c"
